# Overview

This project is a simple word guessing game implemented in Java. The game randomly selects a word from a word bank and the player has to guess the word within a certain number of attempts. The purpose of this project was to practice Java programming, specifically focusing on file I/O, exception handling, and basic data structures like lists.

I wrote this program as an opportunity to practice Java programming and to learn more about the Java language. I wanted to practice reading and writing files, handling exceptions, and using lists in Java. I also wanted to practice using the Java Scanner class to get user input and the Random class to generate random numbers.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
